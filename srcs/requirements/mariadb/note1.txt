Error
PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 36864 bytes) in phar:///usr/local/bin/wp/vendor/wp-cli/wp-cli/php/WP_CLI/Extractor.php on line 100

Fixed by adding this into beginning of WordPress script
echo "memory_limit = 512M" >> /etc/php82/php.ini


docker inspect ngnix-cont | grep "LogDriver"

1. Check Server Logs
2. Server Overload?
3. Meaning "indicates that a server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from an upstream server"?


Fix errors in 

Error : can't log in with sudo/root
docker exec -it mariadb-cont mysql -u root -p
ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'5e7148b72b94' (using password: YES)

1. Check root password
2. Update root password



docker exec -it <container> sh
f.ex. docker exec -it mariadb-cont sh

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD';
to 
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD';
->Took this away. Had too many issues.



What is hostname??

1. Is there an internal safety setting on?
2. Check Viking guide to give permissions coorrectly?
